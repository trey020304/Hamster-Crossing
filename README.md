### Project Dates
🎡 Start Date: November 4, 2024
🎡 Expected Completion Date: November 24, 2024

### Project Overview
Hamster Crossing is an interactive website that demonstrates two path-finding algorithms, A* and Dijkstra's, in a grid-based environment. Users guide a hamster (the subject) to reach a sunflower seed (the goal) while navigating barriers that can be randomly generated or user-defined. Key functionalities include starting/ending point selection, dynamic grid customization, and real-time visualization of algorithmic pathways.
🐹 A Algorithm*: Uses heuristic estimations for expedited route finding.
🐹 Dijkstra's Algorithm: Explores all possible paths consistently.

### Resource Allocation
**Tools and Technologies**
	🌻 Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
	🌻 Backend: JavaScript
	🌻 APIs/Frameworks: TBD
	🌻 Security Tools: TBD
 **Required Resources**
	🌻 GitHub, IDEs for development
	🌻 Multimedia resources for integration

### Success Criteria
*The project will be successful if:*
🎡 The web app accurately visualizes Dijkstra and A* algorithms.
🎡 It meets performance, usability, and security standards.
🎡 All deliverables (source code, documentation, presentation) are completed on time.
